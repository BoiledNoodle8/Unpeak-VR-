UNPEAK (Peak VR)
VR2025
Virtual Reality Project for Fall 2025

Intro
This project is based on the popular game Peak. This game is a co-op multiplayer game with the objective of climbing mountains using stamina and items. The game requires team work to advance in the game.

Mechanics
The player must ascend the mountain with their own might and their friends, using their stamina. Losing health, being dehydrated, or if the player is hungry. The player will lose stanima which might make it harder to ascend the moutain. Game items can help replenish health, thirst, stanima, and hunger. Items like energy drinks will give the player extra stanima to help reach the hard to reach places on the mountain. Climbing, sprinting, jumping will use stamina. Stamina will regenerate over time to a certain amount. How players manage their stamina will be key for them to make progress in the game.

The trigger or buttons on controller will be able to grab and let while climbing and holding objects. Using VR multiplayer other players will be able to join their friends with acsend to the top of the moutains.

Dynamics
Players main goal is to reach the top of the moutain. Once at the top player can revive other players or heal themselves. Once at the top, players can desend the moutain and go other biomes with harder mountians to climb.

Aethethetics
The game has a 3D cartoon aethethetic. The grapics are simple but game feels very big or inifinite at times. The moutains are bigger than the game will render at times, so it feels there is no top to the mountains. This makes it so grand while being so simple looking.
